## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a recreation of the provided portfolio website design as part of the **PLP Web Development Group Assignment**.  
Our goal was to replicate the layout, styling, and responsiveness using only **HTML** and **CSS**, without any JavaScript or frameworks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

**HTML5** — For website structure and content  
* **CSS3** — For layout, styling, and responsiveness  

## ✨ Features

* Responsive portfolio website layout  
* About Me section  
* Projects showcase  
* Contact section  
* Clean and modern design  

## 📝 Solution Approach

* We analyzed the original portfolio website design and broke it down into **clear sections**:  
    **Header**, **About**, **Projects**, **Contact**, and **Footer**.  
* We used **semantic HTML tags** (like `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`) for structure and accessibility.  
* CSS **Flexbox** and **Grid** were used to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.  
* We implemented a **mobile-first design** to ensure usability on both desktop and mobile devices.  
* Consistent **color schemes**, **typography**, and **spacing** were applied to closely match the original design.
